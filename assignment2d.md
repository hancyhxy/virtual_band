For the final Assignment 2 Project Reflection:

1. Briefly describe the Assignment 2 project in general terms, focusing on the most novel and creative parts of the project. 

2. Highlight an important key feature, decision, outcome, or event, that took some careful design and implementation.

Recount – the way that it was designed and implemented. Describe in detail the underlying basis of the key feature, decision, outcome, or event.  
React – to how it turned out - this usually asserting a preference or emotional response of some type, not mere facts. 
Analyse – Why this was the outcome? Try to look for patterns and develop an understanding of the causes of the outcomes created, either good or bad. 
Improve – Describe if theres anything you'd do differently next time? Or if it was great, then how can you ensure this improvement continues to happen?
3. Choose a different feature, decision, outcome, or event. Complete the same reflection cycle one more time. 

The reflection submission asks you to step back and evaluate key components of the project development experience. Reflect on what you learned throughout the process, both about the subject matter and about project management, problem-solving, and your own capabilities. Consider what went well, what proved more challenging than expected, and what you would do differently if starting over. The reflection should also examine how your final product compares to your initial concept - did you achieve your goals, and if not, why? This deliverable demonstrates your ability to think critically about your own work and extract meaningful insights that will inform future projects.
