## PERFORMANCE TIPS

### Drumming Technique:
- **Start slow, build fast** - Creates narrative arc
- **Vary your rhythm** - Don't just hit randomly, create patterns
- **Hit all 4 drums** - Show variety
- **Include Hi-Hat hits** - Showcase the glitch effect (most impressive)
- **Use both hands** - Demonstrates multi-hand tracking
- **Big gestures** - Exaggerated "punches" look better on camera

### Visual Optimization:
- **Maximize browser window** - Fill entire screen
- **Good hand visibility** - Keep hands in well-lit area
- **Smooth movements** - Avoid jerky, unpredictable motions
- **Face optional** - You can crop to just hands + canvas if preferred

### Audio Quality:
- **Turn up volume** - Drum sounds should be clearly audible
- **Minimize background noise** - Close windows, turn off fans
- **Optional background music** - Add subtle music in editing (not required)

---

## POST-PRODUCTION (Optional but Recommended)

### Video Editing (Quick Enhancements):

**Software Options:**
- **Mac:** iMovie (free), Final Cut Pro
- **Windows:** DaVinci Resolve (free), Adobe Premiere Pro
- **Online:** Clipchamp, Kapwing

**Quick Edits:**
1. **Trim to exactly 30 seconds** - Cut off slow start/end
2. **Color correction** - Boost saturation, increase brightness
3. **Add title** - First 2 seconds: "Interactive Visual Drum Kit" fade-in text
4. **Sound mix** - Balance drum audio, add music if desired
5. **Transitions** - Smooth fade-in at start, fade-out at end
6. **Export:** 1920×1080, 30 FPS, MP4

**Advanced Edits (if time allows):**
- **Split-screen:** Show your face + canvas simultaneously
- **Slow-motion:** Highlight a specific drum hit (0.5× speed for 2-3 seconds)
- **Captions:** Label drums as you hit them ("Kick", "Snare", etc.)
- **Background music:** Subtle electronic/ambient track (royalty-free from YouTube Audio Library)

### Audio Enhancements:

If drum sounds are too quiet:
1. Import video into editor
2. Increase audio gain by +6 to +12 dB
3. Optional: Add light compression to even out volume
4. Export

## EMBEDDING IN KEYNOTE

### How to Add Video to Slide 1:

1. **Open Keynote, navigate to Slide 1**
2. **Drag video file** from Finder directly onto slide
3. **Resize and position** video:
   - Option 1: Full-screen background (cover entire slide)
   - Option 2: Centered box with title above/below
4. **Set video playback:**
   - Click video → Format panel → Movie tab
   - ✓ Check "Start movie on click" OR "Play movie automatically"
   - ✓ Check "Loop" (if you want it to repeat)
   - Volume: Set to 50-70% (audible but not overwhelming)
5. **Layer text over video:**
   - Add text boxes for title, your name, etc.
   - Use semi-transparent backgrounds for readability
   - Choose contrasting colors (white text on dark video, or vice versa)

### Keynote Video Playback Tips:
- **Test before presenting** - Play the slide to ensure video works
- **Bring video file separately** - In case Keynote doesn't embed it
- **Export as QuickTime movie** - Keynote → File → Export → QuickTime
- **Backup plan** - Have screenshots ready if video fails

## ALTERNATIVE: LIVE DEMO

If you prefer NOT to pre-record a video:

### Live Demo During Presentation:
**Pros:**
- More impressive (real-time interaction)
- Can respond to audience questions
- Shows confidence in your project

**Cons:**
- Risky (webcam could fail, tracking could glitch)
- Hard to control timing (might go over 5 minutes)
- Less polished than edited video

**If doing live demo:**
1. Have a backup video ready
2. Test in presentation room beforehand
3. Keep it short (30-60 seconds)
4. Narrate what you're doing: "Now I'm triggering the Hi-Hat glitch..."

**Recommendation:** Pre-record a video for safety, but offer live demo during Q&A if tutor is interested.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Hand tracking is jittery in video
**Solution:**
- Ensure good lighting
- Use faster webcam (720p @ 60 FPS if possible)
- Reduce MediaPipe complexity (if configurable)

### Problem: Video is too large (>50 MB)
**Solution:**
- Compress using HandBrake (free)
- Reduce resolution to 1280×720
- Lower bitrate to 5-8 Mbps

### Problem: Drum sounds aren't recording
**Solution:**
- Check recording software captures "System Audio"
- Increase browser volume before recording
- Test with a short 5-second recording first

### Problem: Colors look washed out in recording
**Solution:**
- Increase saturation in post-production
- Boost contrast
- Ensure browser is using hardware acceleration

## FINAL TIPS

1. **Record multiple takes** - You'll get better with each attempt (aim for 3-5 takes)
2. **Watch your recordings** - Review and identify what to improve
3. **Get feedback** - Show to a friend, ask if it's engaging
4. **Keep it simple** - Don't overthink, let your project shine
5. **Have fun** - Your enthusiasm will show in the video!

**Estimated time to create video:**
- Recording: 30 minutes (including practice and multiple takes)

## EXAMPLE VIDEO OUTLINE (Text Description for Reference)

**Title:** "Interactive Visual Drum Kit - 30 Second Demo"

**Description for your presentation notes:**
> "This 30-second demo shows the complete user experience. You'll see my hands tracked in real-time as I explore all four drums - Kick, Snare, Tom, and Hi-Hat. As I build rhythm, the visuals respond with particle bursts and color shifts from cool teal to warm orange. Watch for the glitch effect when I hit the Hi-Hat. The entire interaction is intuitive, responsive, and immersive."

Use this description as your introduction when the video plays on Slide 1.
