Assignment 2: C
There are four linked submissions for this assignment:  1) Concept Development,  2) Draft Implementation Development , 3) Final Presentation; and 4) Reflection. This is the second part of the four, the draft implementation. Please make sure you address the criteria, and consider the rubric, for each of these deliverables.

The final submission is your opportunity to showcase the completed project to your tutors. The presentation of your work should outline the concept and highlight how they were realised in the final outcome. It shouldn't be a narrative of the development process, but instead should focus on the insights, highlights and engaging features of the final outcome. Effective presentations typically include visual aids, live demonstrations, and clear explanations of both technical and non-technical aspects. Do highlight key technical accomplishments, but avoid walking us through every piece of code and parameter you have used. You should also address how your project meets the original objectives and what impact it might have for your target audience. You have 6 minutes for your presentation, and will then need to answer questions about your project. 

Submission: Please submit 6 slides, including a 30 second video, and a code folder, and prepare to present your concept to your tutor. Your marks will be based on your presentation. 

Oral Presentation Ordering: 

1. (5mins) Present A2C project to your tutor. 

2. (3 mins) Answer questions from your tutor about A2C. 

3. (3 mins) Present A2D reflection to your tutor. 

4 (2 mins) Answer questions from your tutor about A2D.

Groupwork: This is an Individual assignment and each student will need to present their work.
